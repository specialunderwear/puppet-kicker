puppet-kicker: cross server puppet notifications
================================================

puppet-kicker requires
`mcollective <http://marionette-collective.org/>`_
with the
`puppetd plugin <http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/mcollective-plugins/wiki/AgentPuppetd>`_
for querying and notifying servers. Be sure to export all your facter/puppet
facts to mcollective.
(`FactsFacterYAML <http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/mcollective-plugins/wiki/FactsFacterYAML>`_ for example)

*Puppet-kicker triggers runs of* ``puppet agent`` *on dependent servers.*

Suppose we've got a
loadbalancer and some nodes that need to be balanced. With puppet-kicker that
pattern looks like this;

On the node, you've got to make sure a fact is available with the name ``role``.
See :ref:`cloudstack` for an example of how to achive this for
`cloudstack <http://www.cloudstack.org/>`_. After that all it takes is

::

    # kick haproxy so it rebuilds it config.
    notify {"kick -> haproxy":}

on the server the ``role`` fact should also be defined and set to 'haproxy'

::

    # collect all the servers with *role* `node`.
    $nodes = servers_with_role('node')
    
    # render a template in wich we use these servers.
    $configfile = template('path-to-template/configfile.erb')
    
    package {"haproxy":
        ensure => installed,
    }
    
    file {"/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg":
        content => $configfile
        notify => Service['haproxy'],
        require => Package['haproxy'],
    }
    
    service {"haproxy":
        ensure => running,
    }
    
and the configfile would look like this

::
    
    global 
          maxconn 4096 
          pidfile /var/run/haproxy.pid 
          daemon 

    defaults 
          mode http 
          retries 3 
          option redispatch 
          maxconn 2000 
          contimeout 5000 
          clitimeout 50000 
          srvtimeout 50000 

    listen <%= @hostname -%>
          bind 0.0.0.0:80
          mode tcp 
          balance roundrobin
          <% nodes.each do node %>
          server <% = node['hostname'] -%> <% node['ipaddress'] -%>:8080 check inter 2000
          <% end -%>

To enable the kicker, you should add the ``kick`` to your reports in puppet.conf::

    reports=log, kick

Available functions
-------------------

These functions always return a list of dictionaries containing all the server
facts.

- servers_with_role: Return all server objects with a certain role:
    servers_with_role('frontend', 'production)
- servers_with_facts:     Return all server objects with all the facts specified.
    servers_with_facts('hostname=new') // returns servers with hostname new

    servers_with_facts('hostname=/^new$|^old$/') // returns servers with hostname either new or old

    servers_with_facts('uptime>10', 'hostname=/lala/') // returns servers with uptime over 10 and hostname matches lala
- server_with_role: Return one server object with a certain role:
    server_with_role('haproxy', { hostname => 'localhost', ipaddress => '127.0.0.1'}) // returns one haproxy server, or localhost server if nothing found.

.. _cloudstack:

Cloudstack
----------

Because we use this with cloudstack, we added
`Jason Hancock <http://geek.jasonhancock.com>`_ his userdata-to-puppetfact
script so we can make the ``role`` userdata available on each server as a puppet fact.
doing this allows us to use that fact as a node classifier instead of an
external node classifier.

In nodes.pp we use the role to classify the node like this::

    case $role {
        'haproxy': {
            include haproxy
        }

        'node': {
            include node
        }
    }

Environments
------------

Puppet-kicker will try to find the environment amongst the facts of your server.
If it can be found, mcollective will be restricted to the collective with the
same name. If it can not be found, no idea what happens.

This means you should make your mcollective agents part of a collective with
the same name as the puppet environment::

  main_collective = <%= @environment -%>
  collectives = mcollective,<%= @environment -%>


caveats
-------

There is no cycle detection built into the kicker. So you've got to be careful
not to introduce cyclic kicks.

in node.pp::

    notify {"kick -> haproxy":}

in haproxy.pp::

    notify {"kick -> node":}

That will keep your puppet agents running forever.

We need cycle detection though, so stay tuned for an update.
